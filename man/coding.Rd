\description{
A `coding` object holds a list of `code`s that map vector values to human
readable labels. An abstraction of factors, this data structure is designed
to be portable and not directly attached to the underlying data. Moreover,
`coding` objects can be "linked" for recoding and data lineage purposes. An
"empty coding" is used to represent data that has no categorical
interpretation.
